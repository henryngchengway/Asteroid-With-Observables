        <br>Turn up the volume for sound effects!!
        <br>Reminder: Dont panic when the game shows up gameOver and there is no collision with your ship
        <br>This is not a bug because the asteroid spawning is in random x & y axis. Therefore, there is a chance that
        <br>the asteroid spawn beside your ship and it immediately detects that there is a collision. But nevertheless,
        <br>the chance of getting this is quite low if you keep moving your ship. Have fun!!</p></div>
